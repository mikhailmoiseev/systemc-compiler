\subsection{Design correctness checking}

SystemC kernel does some design correctness checks during elaboration and simulation. Additional checks required for process function code to comply it with SystemC synthesizable standard. ICSC reports of incorrect or non-synthesizable statements with clear and expressive error messages that reduces designer efforts.

ICSC checks the following violations:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Non-channel object read before initialization;
\item Array out-of-bound access and dangling/null pointer dereference;
\item Inter-process communication through non-channel objects;
\item Objects not assigned at all control flow paths in combinational methods, that leads to latch;
\item Incomplete sensitivity lists for combinational methods;
\item Loop without {\tt wait()} with infinite or non-determinable iteration number.
\end{itemize}
